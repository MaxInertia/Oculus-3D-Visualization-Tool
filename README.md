# Oculus-3D-Visualization-Tool
A tool that allows the visualization  of data from a .csv file in a 3D virtual space.

## Getting Started

These instructions will show you how to get the web service up and running on your own local server using node.js.

### Prerequisites

```
- An internet connection
- Modern internet browser (Chrome, Firefox)
- Node.js
```
To properly run this web service you will need to have Node.js installed.

You may follow instructions on how to install via a package manager here:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

- After installing node.js run the following commands:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
   This will install the needed dependencies.
   Then in the root git directory run...
    ```
    npm start
    ```
   This will host the project on your local server.

Once this is done you may navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
